# Subscription Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the subscription system using Stripe, Next.js, and Supabase.

## Current Progress

### 1. Stripe Setup ✅
- Created Stripe account and enabled test mode
- Set up product with two price points:
  - Monthly subscription
  - Annual subscription (with savings)
- Configured webhook endpoints
- Added Stripe environment variables

### 2. Database Schema ✅
- Added subscription fields to `profiles` table:
  ```sql
  subscription_status text
  subscription_id text
  subscription_ends_at timestamptz
  cancel_at_period_end boolean
  stripe_customer_id text
  ```
- Created `subscription_events` table for audit trail
- Added necessary indexes and constraints
- Configured Row Level Security (RLS)

### 3. Webhook Handler ✅
- Created webhook endpoint at `/api/webhooks/stripe`
- Implemented event handling for:
  - subscription.created
  - subscription.updated
  - subscription.deleted
  - subscription.trial_will_end
  - invoice.payment_failed
- Set up database updates for subscription status changes

## Next Steps

### 4. Subscription Management (In Progress)
- [ ] Create subscription context
- [ ] Implement subscription hooks
- [ ] Build subscription UI components:
  - [ ] Pricing table
  - [ ] Checkout form
  - [ ] Subscription management portal
- [ ] Create API routes for subscription operations

### 5. Access Control
- [ ] Implement subscription-based route protection
- [ ] Add subscription checks to API routes
- [ ] Create middleware for subscription status verification

### 6. User Interface
- [ ] Design and implement pricing page
- [ ] Create subscription management dashboard
- [ ] Add subscription status indicators
- [ ] Implement upgrade/downgrade flows

### 7. Testing
- [ ] Set up Stripe webhook testing environment
- [ ] Create test suite for subscription flows
- [ ] Test different subscription scenarios:
  - [ ] New subscription
  - [ ] Cancellation
  - [ ] Renewal
  - [ ] Failed payment
  - [ ] Plan changes

## Implementation Details

### Environment Variables
```env
# Stripe Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Stripe Products & Pricing
STRIPE_PRODUCT_ID=prod_...
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_MONTHLY=price_...
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_ANNUAL=price_...
```

### Database Schema
The subscription system uses two main tables:

1. **profiles** - Extended with subscription fields
2. **subscription_events** - Audit trail for subscription activities

### Webhook Events
The system handles the following Stripe webhook events:
- `customer.subscription.created`
- `customer.subscription.updated`
- `customer.subscription.deleted`
- `customer.subscription.trial_will_end`
- `invoice.payment_failed`

## Security Considerations
- Webhook signatures are verified using Stripe's webhook secret
- RLS policies ensure users can only access their own subscription data
- Service role is required for webhook-triggered database updates

## Testing
To test webhooks locally:
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
```
